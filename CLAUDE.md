## Build & Test

- **Tests:** `npx vitest run` (run all tests) or `npx vitest run test/<file>` (run a single test file)
- **Lint:** `npm run lint` (uses [standard](https://standardjs.com/) — no semicolons, no trailing commas)

## Conventions

- All changes should include tests where possible
- Tests must pass before submitting
- Lint must pass before submitting
